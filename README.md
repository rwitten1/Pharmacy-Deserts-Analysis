# Pharmacy-Deserts-Analysis
## This repository accompanies a written analysis of pharmacy desert locations and characteristics. 
[insert publication information when ready]
### Inputs and script for analysis
The R file PharmacyDesertAnalysisScript_clean.R contains the code used for analysis including annotations.
This script could be used to reproduce the analysis, with the exception that the source data of pharmacy addresses is not publicly available data and is restricted by a DUA, so is not contained here. 
### Dataset for analysis
The file TractLevelResults.csv contains the resulting 84,414 census tracts and corresponding variables that were used in the final analysis. More details on these calculations is described in the publication or visible in the R script.
The .RDS files can be read into R as objects for further analysis and contain the geo information.
